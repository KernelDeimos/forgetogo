# ForgeToGo

ForgeToGo is an experimental Minecraft server launcher with a web interface.
It is useful for administering your Minecraft server when you're on the go, without the need for SSH
or other remote access tools.

## Warning: experimental

Authentication is on the to-do list, so you should not expose ForgeToGo on a public port in its current state.
If you want to try it out, use it on a LAN or VPN where only people you trust have access.

Remember that on a modded server, unless you've read the code for all the mods and know how they were compiled,
there's no telling what vulnerabilities remote server console access could open to both your Minecraft server
and the machine it's running on.

## Warning: unlicensed

ForgeToGo is currently unlicensed but will probably be released under the MIT License when it is stable.
